# Project Insight
Team Kayak's Project for Terrathon 2022, an event organised at PES University.

For the project, we aimed to identify areas of land all over the country that required attention for redirection of resources to boost irrigation, modern agricultural methods, etc.

We built a dataset by extracting satellite imagery from the United States Geological Survey website, and cropped each picture into many others to train our differentiating model on tensorflow (With a bit of folium)

This model then analysed the testing set that we prepared to create a marker map of India, with a legend and coloured markers to indicate the areas that required attention.
